abstract = {Operating System virtualization has seen major adoption across many industry fields, this growth has driven penetration into more traditional settings such as high performance computing and cluster systems. Developing an effective and efficient teaching environment for virtual high performance computing systems is complicated by a wide range of virtualization systems (open source and commercial), a variety of hardware platforms, and many different storage approaches for storing and distributing virtual machine images. Coupled with the growth in virtualization is the need for reliable, high performance storage subsystems optimized for the specific performance needs of the installation. This paper describes our experiences with using virtualization for virtual high performance computing clusters for education, and compares the performance of the popular OpenNebula virtualization manager using both NFS and SSH for virtual machine image sharing. Our results show it is possible to develop an effective teaching environment using commodity desktop computers and network hardware along with open source virtualization software.},
